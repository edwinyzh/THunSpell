 Important changes only

 ===============================================================================

2022-01-13:
- Downloaded the original version of THunSpell by Stefan Ascher from (https://torry.net/authorsmore.php?id=7163),
  the original version is assumed to be developed for Delphi 6 (Non-unicode Delphi).
- Upgraded to unicode Delphi (XE4) and the demo is running correctly.
- Still uses Hunspell DLL version 1.3.2.

Version 1.13 23.03.2011
  - Fixed right edge.
  - Fixed TabsToSpace
  - Updated to Hunspell version 1.3.2
Version 1.12 13.02.2011
  - Added MaxLineWidth property to THunSpellMemo
  - THunSpellMemo: Move the caret only with a right mouse click when there is no
    selection.
Version 1.11 24.01.2011
  - Added IgnoreAllCaps property to THunSpell.
  - Added CustomDistName property to THunSpell.
Version 1.10 29.12.2010
  - Suggestions returned empty strings - fixed.
  - Fixed division by zero exception (it seems my Trunc function is somehow broken, 
    that's bad).
  - Fixed Access Violation.
Version 1.9 13.12.2010
  - Added RightEdge property to THunSpellMeno. If > 0 it draws a silver line at 
    that position. Works only with fixed width fonts.
Version 1.8 01.12.2010
  - CaretPos is no longer limited to 16-bit values.
  - EM_CHARFROMPOS is no longer limited to files < 64K. If the file is > 64K the 
    returned value is a 32-bit value with the char position, and line number is 
    not returned. Files < 64K still works like it's described in MSDN.
  - Added IgnoreWordsWithNumbers property to THunSpell.
  - Added support for different dictionary encodings. Real UNICODE support still 
    requires some work, but I still use D5.

    it and is even useful (for a Notepad-Fan).
